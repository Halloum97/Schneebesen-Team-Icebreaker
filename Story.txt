Shrek was in a new stage of his life, while Fiona was still asleep he decided to take his hund out for a walk around the swamp.
During his walk, Shrek noticed that a new Bäckerei has opened up offering many Gebäck.
While waiting in line he overheard the song Du Hast by Rammstein.
Donkey burst in and yelled "Shrek, Shrek, you won't believe what I just saw, I'm just going to tell you it's the largest Schloss I've ever seen Fiona would even be impressed." 
Once Shrek heard this, he jumped in the first Porsche he saw with Donkey and raced to the Flughafen. 
Somehow, they made it to the Berlin airport in record time and boarded their flight to travel to the world's largest lock (apparently Shrek used to be a locksmith).
During their flight, Donkey was already daydreaming out loud, saying "I hope we stop by the Raesfeld, they have got this Bratwurst the size of my head! And a biergarten too! I'm starving just thinking about it."
