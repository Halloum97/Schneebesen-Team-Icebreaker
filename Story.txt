Shrek was in a new stage of his life, while Fiona was still asleep he decided to take his hund out for a walk around the swamp.
During his walk, Shrek noticed that a new Bäckerei has opened up offering many Gebäck.
While waiting in line he overheard the song Du Hast by Rammstein.
Donkey burst in and yelled "Shrek, Shrek, you won't believe what I just saw, I'm just going to tell you it's the largest Schloss I've ever seen Fiona would even be impressed."
